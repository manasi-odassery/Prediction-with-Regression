Overview
This repository contains two distinct predictive modeling projects developed to enhance decision-making processes in HR and logistics operations. The models utilize simple linear regression to predict salaries based on years of experience and delivery times based on sorting times. Each model is aimed at providing strategic insights that support better resource allocation, budgeting, and operational efficiencies.

Models
Salary Prediction Model: Predicts future salary hikes based on the years of experience, aiding HR in budget planning and salary structuring.
Delivery Time Prediction Model: Estimates delivery times from sorting durations to optimize logistical operations and improve customer satisfaction.
